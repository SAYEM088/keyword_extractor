this is our data and 
we will refine and able to extract name :
                
                output : "Indian Rogan Josh Lamb Quesadilla"
                
again a have look at another example:

                "\codeblack92_Mango_Pineapple_Cupcake_Creation_21c76fb6-9f38-44fa-bfb3-5cbf6a7f2344_block_1_1.jpg"
                 output : "Mango Pineapple Cupcake Creation"


That means there is no pattern of the data, and we dont need any instruction from user,
additionally if any user want to erase any name we have and field for that.
